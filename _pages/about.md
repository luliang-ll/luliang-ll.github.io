I am currently a Software Engineer at Cisco, responsible for designing and implementing the core funtionality for the Webex App Calendar Service as a Java developer. Previously, I got my master degree in Software Engineering from University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in 2021, supervised by [Prof.Lei Wang](https://cs.uwlax.edu/~lwang/). My research interests include Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.



## üìë Papers

Houlin Chen, **Lu Liang** and Lei Wang. **Improving Indoor Tracking Accuracy through Sensor Fusion: A Low-Cost, Neural Network-Assisted Visual System for Real-time Position Estimation**. Future Technologies Conference (FTC) in the series "Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems" 2023.

- Abstract: A low-cost, GPS-independent model of a neural network-assisted visual tracking system is proposed. In the test phase, the proposed system obtatined a tracking accuracy of 0.5m without any help from expensive depth cameras or 3D LIDAR.

**Lu Liang**. **Indoor Localization and Tracking Based on Neural Network**. Postgraduate Dissertation, 2021.

- Abstract: This manuscript describes a neural network-based indoor localization and tracking method. Through testing and experimental results, the proposed system significantly improves the accuracy, anti-interence ability, and real-time performance of indoor tracking systems.

**Lu Liang**. **Face Detection based on Skin Color Model and Face Geometric Features**. Undergraduate Disseertation, 2019.

- Abstract: In this thesis the algorithm based on the elliptical skin color model and the face geometric feature detection in YCbCr color space is used for face detection. The experimental results and data illustrated in this paper show that the alogorithm used in this paper has a low miss detection rate and can achieve more accurate face detection.
